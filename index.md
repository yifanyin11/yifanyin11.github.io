**Welcome to my site!** I am a graduate assistant at [_Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics_](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/), the Johns Hopkins University. My academic interests are on **_perception and cognitive systems_** in Robotics applications. I love involving in creative work or exploring the depth on interesting topics. Feel free to browse in the site and learn things about me.

## Academic Life

### Work Experience
Research Assistant \
_Feb. 2022 – Present_  

* Working on visual perception of a mosquito micro-dissection system 
* Background in Robotic Programming System (ROS), camera models, object detection, semantic segmentation, visual-servoing methods, perception systems
* Developed semantic segmentation algorithms using Mask R-CNN for the detection and localization the robot tooltip; results up to subpixel accuracy
* Designed and implemented a 2D domain randomization pipeline for data augmentation and image label refinements; the optimized tool can generate ~800 images with random or given backgrounds per min for training 
* Participated in the development of a framework for integrated data managements during network training, inference and evaluation, to keep data streams organized     
* Design and implement visual-servoing methods for accurate robot manipulation
